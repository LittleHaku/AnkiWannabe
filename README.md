# AnkiWannabe

Kotlin project where I try to make a flashcard app similar to Anki using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose following a Material Design. The app allows for user authentication using firebase and also syncs to the cloud. This project is just for educational purposes @ankilawyers

This project main focus was to learn how to make an Android app using Kotlin and the new Jetpack Compose, not to make a rival to Anki, I'd suggest using Anki instead.
